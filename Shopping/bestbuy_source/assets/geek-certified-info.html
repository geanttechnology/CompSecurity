        <p class="title"><b>WHAT DOES CERTIFIED REFURBISHED MEAN?</b></p>
        <p>All Geek Squad Certified Refurbished products are thoroughly, painstakingly and lovingly tested and confirmed on a number of inspection points prior to sale.
        Most of the products we sell as Geek Squad Certified Refurbished come to us from customer returns made at Best Buy stores. The returned devices are given the once-over by store staff, then turned over to specially-trained Agents who put them through a standardized process to make sure they are ready to be sold. We thoroughly test and inspect each refurbished device to make sure it works as it did when it first came from the factory. We are so confident in the quality of our work that we stand behind every Geek Squad Certified Refurbished product with a Limited Warranty (see warranty details below).</p>
