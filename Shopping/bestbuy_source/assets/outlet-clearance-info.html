        <p class="title"><b>Clearance</b></p>
        <p>These are brand-new, factory-sealed products that are end of stock or discontinued by the manufacturer. Clearance products are backed by the full manufacturer's warranty and Best Buy's <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/return-exchange-policy/pcmcat260800050014.c?id=pcmcat260800050014">Return &amp; Exchange Promise</a>.</p><br>

        <p><b><a id="Excellent-Certified">Excellent-Certified</a></b></p>
        <p>Select product categories are eligible for certification, and each Excellent-Certified product has passed the Geek Squad® Certification process, a rigorous multipoint inspection designed to ensure the highest performance and quality standards. These products look brand new in appearance — with no physical flaws, scratches or scuffs — and include the original parts* and accessories, as well as the original box (or a suitable replacement). In addition, the product is professionally cleaned, then repackaged with care to give you a product as near to new as possible.<br>Learn more about <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/certified-programs/default.aspx">Geek Squad Certified</a> programs and eligible product categories.<br><span class="note">* May not include the owner's manual or manufacturer registration card.</span>

        <p><b><a id="Excellent">Excellent</a></b></p>
        <p>
        Products in excellent condition look brand new in appearance — with no physical flaws, scratches or scuffs — and include all original parts* and accessories. The product will be in its original packaging or a suitable replacement box.<br><span class="note">* May not include the owner's manual or manufacturer registration card.</span>
        </p>
        <p><b><a id="Satisfactory">Satisfactory</a></b></p>
        <p>
        Products in satisfactory condition will show minor to moderate signs of use that affect cosmetic appearance, but have no impact on performance. If the product has a screen, it will be intact and fully functional, with no visible blemishes in the viewing area. (A satisfactory product will not include dents, chips, cracks or deep scratches.) In addition, original packaging is typically not present, and nonessential parts or accessories may be missing, such as a commonly available cable or remote (identified on the product in store or on the product's detail page online). These factors are all accounted for in the savings you'll see.
        </p>
        <p><b><a id="Fair">Fair</a></b></p>
        <p>
        These products will operate as intended, but will show more significant scratches, dents or chips — for example, an appliance returned to our stores with a dent or large scratch, or a TV with a minor scuff on the screen that doesn't affect viewing quality. Original packaging is typically not included and more vital accessories are commonly missing, like a TV's pedestal or a proprietary cable (identified on the product in store or on the product's detail page online). However, if you can accept the flaws, you'll also realize substantial savings.
