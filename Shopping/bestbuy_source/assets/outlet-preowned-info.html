        <p class="title"><b>Pre-Owned</b></p>
        <p>Pre-owned products have been opened and used (some for weeks or months, others for a year or more), and were typically acquired through the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Electronics-Promotions/Online-Trade-In/pcmcat133600050011.c?id=pcmcat133600050011">Best Buy Trade-In program.</a></p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Pre-owned games were sent from our stores to a refurbishment center. All disc-based games have been resurfaced to remove scratches and ensure they're in playable condition. Games were also repackaged (may include replacement artwork or manual). Best Buy's <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/return-exchange-policy/pcmcat260800050014.c?id=pcmcat260800050014">Return &amp; Exchange Promise</a> applies to all pre-owned games.</li>
                <li>Other pre-owned products are inspected and verified to function properly, cleaned top to bottom, and restored to original factory specifications (as applicable). These products may not include all parts and accessories (details are provided for each item), and usually do not have original packaging. Pre-owned products sold by Best Buy often include a limited warranty through Best Buy, and are backed by Best Buy's <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/return-exchange-policy/pcmcat260800050014.c?id=pcmcat260800050014">Return &amp; Exchange Promise</a>. Pre-owned products sold by Marketplace Sellers (including CowBoom, a Best Buy Brand) do not include a warranty, and return policy details are available for each Seller through the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcat17099&type=page">Marketplace Seller Directory</a>.</li>

        <p class="title"><b>Product Conditions</b></p>
        <p><b><a id="Excellent-Certified">Excellent-Certified</a></b></p>
        <p>Select product categories are eligible for certification, and each Excellent-Certified product has passed the Geek Squad® Certification process, a rigorous multipoint inspection designed to ensure the highest performance and quality standards. These products look brand new in appearance — with no physical flaws, scratches or scuffs — and include the original parts* and accessories, as well as the original box (or a suitable replacement). In addition, the product is professionally cleaned, then repackaged with care to give you a product as near to new as possible.<br>Learn more about <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/certified-programs/default.aspx">Geek Squad Certified</a> programs and eligible product categories.<br><span class="note">* May not include the owner's manual or manufacturer registration card.</span>
        </p>
        <p><b><a id="Excellent">Excellent</a></b></p>
        <p>
            Products in excellent condition look brand new in appearance — with no physical flaws, scratches or scuffs — and include all original parts* and accessories. The product will be in its original packaging or a suitable replacement box.<br><span class="note">* May not include the owner's manual or manufacturer registration card.</span>
        </p>
        <p><b><a id="Satisfactory">Satisfactory</a></b></p>
        <p>
            Products in satisfactory condition will show minor to moderate signs of use that affect cosmetic appearance, but have no impact on performance. If the product has a screen, it will be intact and fully functional, with no visible blemishes in the viewing area. (A satisfactory product will not include dents, chips, cracks or deep scratches.) In addition, original packaging is typically not present, and nonessential parts or accessories may be missing, such as a commonly available cable or remote (identified on the product in store or on the product's detail page online). These factors are all accounted for in the savings you'll see.
        </p>
        <p><b><a id="Fair">Fair</a></b></p>
        <p>
            These products will operate as intended, but will show more significant scratches, dents or chips — for example, an appliance returned to our stores with a dent or large scratch, or a TV with a minor scuff on the screen that doesn't affect viewing quality. Original packaging is typically not included and more vital accessories are commonly missing, like a TV's pedestal or a proprietary cable (identified on the product in store or on the product's detail page online). However, if you can accept the flaws, you'll also realize substantial savings.
